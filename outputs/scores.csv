2. The resulting risk classification according to TARA (Threat Analysis & Risk Assessment).

You must:

A. Derive all five AP factors:
   - elapsed time
   - specialist expertise
   - knowledge of the item or component
   - window of opportunity
   - equipment

B. Provide justifications based on the CVSS vector and description.

C. Map CVSS metrics to AP decisions (CVSS â†’ AP mapping).

D. Estimate the **overall Attack Potential** (Low, Medium, High, Very High).

E. Assess the **Impact Rating (TARA)**:
   - Safety (S0â€“S3)
   - Financial (F0â€“F3)
   - Operational (O0â€“O3)
   - Privacy (P0â€“P3)

F. Conclude with the **overall Risk Level**: Low / Medium / High / Critical
